    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Ivan.
        \n\nI’m the developer of this wonderful app.
        \n\nMaybe, it’s too simple, but so far, so good.
        \n\nI promise you, my next app will do more things.
        \n\nThe goal of writing this quite a long text is to observe
        how it’s displayed on the scroll view.
        \n\nA month ago I visited Córdoba. It’s an amazing city!
        \n\nRecently I went to Lisbon, and that city is incredible as well!
        \n\nIf everything goes well, in two weeks I’ll travel to Palencia.
        I guess Palencia is a quieter place, with almost no tourists, although,
        perhaps, I’m mistaken.
        \n\nA trip is always a surprise, so let’s see.
        Anyway, it should be a great time.
        \n\nThanks. Bye!\n\n
